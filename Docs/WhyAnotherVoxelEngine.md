# Why another Voxel Engine

I have been working on an MC-like sandbox mobile game project for the past years.

We develop a voxel engine inspired by Minecraft. We also referenced two other opensource proejcts -
Truecraft and Cubequity.

Some features we focused on:

- Written in C# and Work on Unity
- Heavy optimized for running on Mobile device
- Be friendly to Lua-binding
- Support blueprints.
- Multithreading
- Bridging the voxel world and the physics world.
